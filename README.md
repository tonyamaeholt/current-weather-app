# Local Weather App
#### By Tonya Holt

This is a project I'm creating for the 100 Days of Code. It uses the Open Weathermap API to get current weather for a provided location.

If you would like to improve the code, submit documentation, etc. please fork the repo and submit a pull request. Thank you!!
